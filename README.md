# Cookie Clicker Not (A.K.A a really really really shitty verion of it)

This project is a simple and basic implementation of a cookie-clicking game using Pygame.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (install using `pip install pygame`)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
     write the "pip install pygame"
     if that doesn't work then you might have a newer version of python in which you can instead use "pre pip install pygame"
3. Because of my shit code, you'll have to download all the pngs and add it into the same folder that the game is in

### Running the Game

Run the main script to start the game:
  simply run the code however you do it in your editor
  example :
  - python simplegame.py
  - py simplegame.py
  - python3 simplegame.py
